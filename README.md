# Loyality_Platform
Project developed for the Software Engineering exam, addressed in the third year of Computer Science in Camerino.

### DESCRIPTION
The idea of the project is to help all businesses to increase the retention rate, retain new customers and acquire new ones.
As this project is being developed in pairs for the Software Engineering exam, many things will not be implemented in the code, this project is considered as a prototype.

## LOYALITY PROGRAMS

### 1)Points Program
The points system focuses on the principle that the more you spend, the more points you get. Every time that
a customer makes a purchase, gets a certain number of points, depending on the expenditure. By rewarding customers with redeemable points, you increase the customer's average order value e
you encourage the latter to invest in your establishment â€” so it is less likely that the customer
step up to the competition.

### 2) Tiered Program
The tiered system focuses on layers of loyalty. Put in other words, the more faithful are the customers (that is: the more they buy from you), the more levels they will unlock, thus receiving rewards
increasingly important.

### 3) Exclusive Membership
The idea behind a paid program is to make loyal customers feel more like VIPs. In other
words, the owner of a (digital) loyalty card is part of an exclusive club that
guarantees a series of equally exclusive services

### 4) Program with Cashback
The basic principle is that of collecting points, the difference consists in recognizing the
customer a cash value in proportion to the amount spent to be used in purchases
subsequent.

### 5) Coalition Program
The coalition program implies, as the name suggests, a collaboration with
other businesses to offer your customers discounts and benefits not only with your brand, but also
with other associated brands.

## PLATFORM BREACKDOWN
The idea is to divide the platform into 2 parts
### COSTUMERS where we can :
- Create a Card.
- Vaslidate a purchase.
- Identify the Client.

Subsequenlty, once identified, the profile must be able to carry out actions such as:
1. See received messages
2. Points history
3. The visits made
4. Coupons avaible
5. etc.

### BACKOFFICE where we find:
- Administrator
- Configuration
- Functionality
- Campaigns
- Data and Statistics

For each sector, there are many features, some will be mentioned such as:

- Create users with full or restricted access to the entire platform
- Bill
- Invoice Messages
- Loyality program recap
- Loyality space
- many others.
